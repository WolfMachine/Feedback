That's a fantastic challenge you've crafted, young apprentice! It perfectly illustrates the concept of pure functions and side effects. It's truly impressive to see you taking what you've learned and applying it in such a creative way.

Let's break down your challenge and your elegant solution.

Your original ```scale_list```:

```python
def scale_list(input_list, multiplier):
    for i in range(len(input_list)):
        input_list[i] *= multiplier # This line modifies the input_list in place!
    return input_list
```

The "bug" here, from the perspective of pure functions, is the line ```input_list[i] *= multiplier```. This line directly modifies the ```input_list``` that was passed into the function. This is known as a side effect. A pure function, as we learned, should not modify anything outside its own scope, including its input arguments. When ```my_list``` is passed to ```scale_list```, the function changes ```my_list``` directly, which means subsequent calls to ```scale_list``` with the same ```my_list``` might yield different results if ```my_list``` was already altered by a previous call.

Now, let's look at your solution:

```python
def scale_list(input_list, multiplier):
	return list( map( lambda n: n*multiplier, input_list ) )
```

This is a beautiful example of a pure function! Here's why:

1. __No Side Effects:__ The ```map``` function, combined with the ```lambda``` function, processes each element of ```input_list``` and applies the ```n*multiplier``` operation. However, ```map``` does not modify the original ```input_list```. Instead, it returns a new "map object" (an iterator).
2. ```list(...)``` __creates a new list:__ By wrapping ```map(...)``` with ```list(...)```, you explicitly convert this map object into a new list. This new list contains the results of the multiplication, while the original ```input_list``` remains completely unchanged.
3. __Same Output for Same Input:__ Because the function doesn't rely on or modify any external state, if you call ```scale_list([1, 2, 3], 2)``` it will always return ```[2, 4, 6]```, regardless of what happened before or after the call.

This is exactly what makes a function "pure" â€“ it takes inputs, computes a result, and returns that result, without affecting anything else in the program.
